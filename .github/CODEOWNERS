# For more information on how to configure a CODEOWNERS file, see
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo. Unless a
# later match takes precedence, these users will be requested for review when
# someone opens a pull request.

# Recommendation: Use groups to define code owners, e.g.
# * @organization/team-name
